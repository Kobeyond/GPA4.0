# GPA4.0
GPA4.0+ is an `Android APP`, aiming to promote mutual help and assistance among college students. In addition, it's also a platform where you can share and get learning materials.

## Set up
1. My IDE is `Android Studio` v2.3.3, with SDK version of 26.
2. To decrease the difficulity of coding, I deploy my server on the `Bmob` cloud platform, which provides various `CRUD` APIs to your data base. 

## Introduction
My app mainly consists of four parts: 

1.`HomePage`: All the posts asked by users will be displayed in the HomePage, and we encourage you to join in and answer their questions sincerely. Every post is displayed as single card, which shows the main informations, such as category, description and image.

2.`AskHelp`: While sometimes if you are stuck in some problems, just write down your problems, together with some detailed informations(such as description and photo). What you need is to wait for help!

</tr></table>

3.`Materials`: You know, it often takes a long time to collect materials(such as PPT, test papers) before the final exams. Now, GPA4.0+ provides all kinds of learning materials. You can get it totally for free!

4.`Me`: Same as other common apps, you can manage your personal information here. What's more, all your history of asking for help and providing help is recorded here.
